  "body": "Hi! My name is Ashley and I am thrilled that you are looking for a supervisor - that means that you're already deep into either becoming a psychologist or expanding your practice. We have so much to talk about!</br></br>I have been a psychologist since 2019, after completing my Masters of Professional Psychology. Since then I have worked across disability, defense and private sectors. I currently work at a successful private practice where I have found a fantastic niche for myself with trauma, neurodiversity and the LGTBQIA+ community. I am well versed in CBT, ACT and also utilise DBT, IFS and somatic tools.</br></br>While Psychology is my passion in life, I also spend a lot of time on art, bird-watching and going down wikipedia rabbit holes. Previous feedback about my mentoring style has been that I am straightforward, constructive, knowledgeable and warm."
